 # SPORK -DEVELOPMENT BRANCH
#### Spork for Spark - Does interesting, and probably useful, things with Spark
It's all very dodgy currently; some stuff works, some stuff might give you crabs. Use at your own risk.

* Export your Spark API token to the environment:
"export SPARK_ACCESS_TOKEN="token"
* Spam some stuff, show some rooms, enjoy life
* Beer me
